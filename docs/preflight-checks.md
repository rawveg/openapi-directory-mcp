# Pre-flight Check System

## Overview

The pre-flight check system provides fast, early detection of common issues before they reach the expensive CI/CD pipeline. It's designed to fail fast with specific, actionable error messages.

## Philosophy

1. **Fail Fast, Fail Cheap** - Catch issues in seconds, not minutes
2. **Specific Errors** - Tell developers exactly what's wrong and how to fix it
3. **Self-Adjusting** - No hardcoded numbers, derives truth from the codebase
4. **Linear Complexity** - Each check is independent for easy debugging

## Running Pre-flight Checks

```bash
# Run all pre-flight checks
npm run preflight

# Typical output when all checks pass:
üöÄ Running Pre-flight Checks

Checking Build Output... ‚úÖ (0ms)
   All build directories present
Checking Tool Exposure... ‚úÖ (83ms)
   All 22 tools properly exposed
Checking Prompt Exposure... ‚úÖ (63ms)
   All 23 prompts properly exposed
Checking Mock Validation... ‚úÖ (1032ms)
   All mocks properly implement required methods
Checking TypeScript... ‚úÖ (1635ms)
   TypeScript compilation successful
Checking ESLint... ‚úÖ (1309ms)
   No linting errors or warnings

============================================================
‚úÖ All pre-flight checks passed!
Ready for CI/CD pipeline execution.
```

## Available Checks

### 1. Build Output Check
- **What it checks**: Ensures `dist/` directory exists with required subdirectories
- **Common failure**: Forgetting to run `npm run build`
- **Fix**: `npm run build`

### 2. Tool Exposure Check
- **What it checks**: Counts tool files in `dist/tools/*/` and verifies they're all exposed via ToolHandler
- **Common failure**: Missing tool category in `src/tools/generator.ts`
- **Fix**: Ensure all tool categories are included in `generateTools()`
- **Self-adjusting**: Automatically adjusts expected count based on actual files

### 3. Prompt Exposure Check
- **What it checks**: Counts prompt files in `dist/prompts/*/` and verifies they're all exposed via PromptHandler
- **Common failure**: Missing prompt category in loader
- **Fix**: Ensure all prompt categories are included in the loader
- **Self-adjusting**: Automatically adjusts expected count based on actual files

### 4. Mock Validation Check
- **What it checks**: Runs mock validation tests to ensure test doubles implement all required methods
- **Common failure**: Adding new methods to API clients without updating mocks
- **Fix**: Update mock implementations in test files
- **Why it matters**: Prevents integration test failures due to incomplete mocks

### 5. TypeScript Check
- **What it checks**: Runs `tsc --noEmit` to validate TypeScript compilation
- **Common failure**: Type errors in code
- **Fix**: `npm run typecheck` and fix all errors

### 6. ESLint Check
- **What it checks**: Runs ESLint with zero warnings tolerance
- **Common failure**: Unused variables, formatting issues
- **Fix**: `npm run lint:fix` for auto-fixable issues

## Error Messages

Each check provides specific, actionable error messages:

```bash
‚ùå PRE-FLIGHT FAILED: Tool exposure mismatch
Expected: 22 tools (based on file count)
Actually exposed: 17 tools
Check: src/tools/generator.ts - ensure all tool categories are included
```

## CI/CD Integration

The pre-flight checks run as the first job in our CI/CD pipeline:

```yaml
jobs:
  preflight:
    name: Pre-flight Checks
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
      - run: npm run preflight
  
  # All other jobs depend on preflight passing
  test:
    needs: preflight
    # ...
```

## Git Hooks

For local development, you can install a pre-push hook:

```bash
# Install git hooks
./scripts/install-hooks.sh

# The pre-push hook will:
# 1. Run pre-flight checks before pushing
# 2. Block the push if checks fail
# 3. Provide specific fix instructions

# To bypass in emergencies (not recommended):
git push --no-verify
```

## Implementation Details

The pre-flight system is implemented in `scripts/preflight-checks.js` using:

- **ES Modules** for modern JavaScript
- **Class-based checks** for extensibility
- **ANSI colors** for better readability
- **Async/await** for clean async code
- **Child process exec** for running Node checks

### Adding New Checks

To add a new pre-flight check:

1. Create a new class extending `PreflightCheck`:

```javascript
class MyNewCheck extends PreflightCheck {
  constructor() {
    super('My Check Name', 'What this check validates');
  }

  async run() {
    try {
      // Perform your check
      if (everythingIsGood) {
        return this.pass('Optional success message');
      } else {
        return this.fail(
          'Specific error message\n' +
          'What went wrong\n' +
          'How to fix it'
        );
      }
    } catch (error) {
      return this.fail(`Check failed: ${error.message}`);
    }
  }
}
```

2. Add it to the checks array in `runPreflightChecks()`

## Benefits

1. **Time Savings**: Developers get feedback in ~5 seconds instead of waiting for full CI/CD
2. **Cost Savings**: Avoided CI/CD runs save compute resources
3. **Better DX**: Clear, actionable errors improve developer experience
4. **Knowledge Capture**: Each check encodes a lesson learned from a real bug
5. **Confidence**: If pre-flight passes, CI/CD is likely to pass too

## Common Patterns Caught

Based on real issues encountered:

1. **Missing Tool Exposure**: When `generateUtilityTools()` wasn't called in generator
2. **Incomplete Mocks**: When new methods added to clients without updating test mocks
3. **Build Artifacts**: When changes made without rebuilding
4. **Type Errors**: When TypeScript errors would fail CI/CD
5. **Lint Issues**: When code style violations would fail quality gates

## Troubleshooting

### All checks pass locally but CI/CD fails

1. Ensure you've pushed all changes: `git status`
2. Check Node version matches CI: `node --version` (should be 18+)
3. Clean install dependencies: `rm -rf node_modules && npm ci`
4. Full rebuild: `npm run build`

### Pre-flight takes too long

Some checks can be run in parallel. Current implementation runs sequentially for clear output, but this could be optimized if needed.

### Check fails without clear reason

Run with Node debugging:
```bash
NODE_ENV=development npm run preflight
```

Or check the specific test that's failing:
```bash
npm test tests/unit/test-infrastructure/mock-validation.test.ts
```
