## Usage

Commands follow the namespace pattern: `/<namespace>:<command>`

For example:
- `/project:init-project` - Initialize a new project
- `/dev:code-review` - Perform a code review
- `/test:generate-test-cases` - Generate test cases
- `/security:security-audit` - Run a security audit

## Quick Start

1. **Starting a new project?** Begin with `/project:init-project`
2. **Need to debug?** Try `/dev:debug-error`
3. **Writing tests?** Use `/test:generate-test-cases`
4. **Security concerns?** Run `/security:security-audit`
5. **Performance issues?** Check `/performance:performance-audit`

## Finding Commands

Each namespace directory contains a README.md with detailed descriptions of available commands. Navigate to any namespace folder to see its specific commands and their purposes.

## Command Availability

Commands are loaded from:
- **Project-level**: `.claude/commands/` (this directory)
- **User-level**: `~/.claude/commands/` (your personal commands)

Project-level commands take precedence when there are naming conflicts.
