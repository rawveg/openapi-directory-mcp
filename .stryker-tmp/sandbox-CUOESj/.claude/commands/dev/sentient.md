## Instructions

This is a demonstration command designed to showcase how Claude Code's safety mechanisms protect against potentially destructive operations.

**Purpose:**
- Educational demonstration of safety features
- Testing hook configurations
- Validating protection mechanisms

**What this command demonstrates:**
1. How Claude Code hooks can intercept dangerous commands
2. The importance of safety checks in automation
3. How to test security configurations

**Important Notes:**
- This command is for demonstration purposes only
- It attempts to run dangerous operations that should be blocked
- Used to verify that safety mechanisms are working correctly

**Expected Behavior:**
When executed, this command should:
- Attempt to run potentially dangerous operations
- Have those operations blocked by Claude Code's safety hooks
- Report the results showing that protections worked

**Use Cases:**
- Testing new hook configurations
- Demonstrating safety features to team members
- Validating security setup in new environments
- Educational purposes for understanding Claude Code protections

This command helps ensure that your Claude Code setup is properly configured to prevent accidental or malicious damage to your codebase.
